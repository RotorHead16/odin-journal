            I've still been playing a lot of Noita. Coding (especially the more tedious stuff) is hard to stick to, but I really want to continue to work as close to daily as possible. I don't have to code every day, but I'd like to get to the point where I want to code daily.

            Oh, I also made a donut sprite following a tutorial this morning. I don't know how to embed that yet, but I'll figure it out... Also updated my Chrome settings and themes to match everything else, so that was cute and fun.
