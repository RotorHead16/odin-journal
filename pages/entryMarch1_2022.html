            I've had a lot of anxiety about moving forward, and so haven't really done anything in almost a month. But that's okay. I have a goal, and I'm going to keep picking it back up until I finish through. I'll do some review today, and try to keep on top of things. What matters is that I keep trying and don't give up.
